================================================================================3
🔹 Malware 概述與運作方式（惡意軟體介紹）
Malware is malicious software.
惡意軟體（Malware）就是惡意的程式軟體。

It's a very broad term that we use to describe software 
that's performing bad functions to our computer or to other devices on the network.
這是一個非常廣泛的術語，用來描述那些對我們的電腦或網路中的其他裝置執行有害功能的軟體。

This might be some malware that's collecting keystrokes and sending those keystrokes back to the bad guys.
這可能是某種記錄你鍵盤輸入並將這些資料傳送給駭客的惡意軟體。

Maybe your computer is participating in a large botnet 
and it's the malware that's installed on your computer that controls all of those processes.
也許你的電腦已經成為大型殭屍網路（botnet）的一部分，而這一切是由安裝在你電腦上的惡意軟體所操控的。

Maybe you've got messages and advertising popping up whenever you browse the internet 
and it's malware that's causing those ads to appear on your screen.
也許你在上網時，常常出現彈跳訊息或廣告，這些就是由惡意軟體引起的。

Or maybe it's just a traditional virus and worm that is causing problems on your computer, 
encrypting your data, deleting things off of your hard drive,
或者，它可能是一個傳統的病毒或蠕蟲，對你的電腦造成問題，例如加密資料、刪除硬碟上的檔案，

and leaving you with having to collect whatever's left after you remove the malware from your computer.
最後你只能在清除惡意軟體後，試著搶救剩下的資料。

🔹 Malware 的類型與範圍
There's many different kinds of malware, and in this course, 
we'll have separate videos that break down a number of these topics into much more detail.
惡意軟體種類很多，在本課程中我們會有各自的影片，詳細介紹這些主題。

One very broad range of malware is a virus, and that's also a little bit different than perhaps, crypto-malware,
其中一類廣泛的惡意軟體是病毒，而它與像是加密型惡意軟體（crypto-malware）略有不同，

which can be used to encrypt all of the data on your computer, 
and that's also one that you might see associated with ransomware.
加密型惡意軟體可以加密你電腦上所有的資料，也常與勒索軟體（ransomware）相關聯。

We also have other types of malware that can move on its own between computers-- those would be worms.
還有其他可以自行在電腦間傳播的惡意軟體——那就是蠕蟲（worms）。

We also have Trojan horses that might be presented to us as something that looks like it's benign, 
but indeed, is malware once it gets installed on your computer.
還有木馬程式（Trojan horse），表面看起來無害，但一旦安裝在電腦上，就會執行惡意行為。

🔹 Rootkit、Keylogger 等常見惡意軟體
Rootkits are another type of malware that we'll talk about in a separate video,
Rootkit 是另一種惡意軟體，我們會在另一部影片中說明，

along with key loggers, adware and spyware, and also, botnets.
同時還會講到鍵盤側錄器（Keylogger）、廣告軟體（Adware）、間諜軟體（Spyware）以及殭屍網路（Botnets）。

🔹 惡意軟體是怎麼進入電腦的？
For the bad guys to get malware on to your computer, there are a number of processes that usually take place.
駭客想將惡意軟體植入你的電腦，通常會經歷幾個步驟。

The first step is usually finding a vulnerability.
第一步通常是找到一個漏洞。

This might be a vulnerability in the operating system or you, the end user, might be the vulnerability,
這個漏洞可能來自作業系統，也可能是你這位終端使用者成為漏洞來源，

clicking on things that are inside of an email link.
例如點擊了電子郵件中的連結。

Or clicking on things that look benign, but instead, have some malware associated with them.
或者是點了看起來正常但實際含有惡意程式的東西。

Once that particular piece of software is executing on your computer, it usually installs this piece of malware that might include a back door.
當這段程式在你電腦上執行後，通常會安裝惡意軟體，其中可能包含後門（backdoor）。

This gives a way for the bad guys to get back into your computer, even if you're behind a firewall.
這樣駭客就能再次遠端進入你的電腦，即使你有防火牆保護。

惡意軟體如何被安裝進電腦 (續)
A botnet might even be installed after that point.
在那之後，甚至還可能會被安裝進一個殭屍網路（botnet）。

Since they now have access to your computer, they can install and change anything they'd like inside of your computing device.
既然他們已經能進入你的電腦，他們就可以隨意安裝、修改你設備裡的任何東西。

For malware to embed itself onto your computer, there has to be at least one program that runs initially.
惡意軟體要嵌入你的電腦，必須至少有一個程式先被執行。

We'll often find these bad links inside of emails-- that's why we often tell people not to click links that are inside an email.
我們常常在電子郵件中看到這些惡意連結——這就是為什麼我們經常提醒大家不要點擊信中的連結。

Instead, open up your browser and type in the name of the destination in the address bar yourself.
相反地，應該自己打開瀏覽器，手動輸入網址。

🔹 網站與「駕駛式下載」（Drive-by download）
Some of this malware you might see on a website.
有些惡意軟體你可能會在網站上遇到。

You receive a pop-up that then takes you to another location by clicking on some of the links that are on that website.
你會看到彈跳視窗，點了網站上的連結後，就會被導向其他地方。

Sometimes, a file will simply be downloaded to your computer when you visit a malicious URL.
有時候，當你瀏覽一個惡意網址時，檔案會自動被下載到你的電腦。

That malicious website is simply performing what's called a drive-by download.
這種惡意網站的行為就稱為「駕駛式下載（Drive-by Download）」。

If you visit that page, it will download this file onto your computer.
只要你造訪該頁面，它就會下載檔案到你的電腦上。

🔹 無需人為操作的惡意軟體
What might be even worse is a worm that doesn't need human intervention.
更糟的是有些蠕蟲不需要人為操作就能傳播。

It simply will install itself onto your computer across the network and you don't have to click anything to become infected by that piece of malware.
它可以在網路中自行安裝到你的電腦上，你根本不用點任何東西就會中毒。

🔹 為什麼你需要保持更新
Researchers are finding new vulnerabilities in our operating systems, in our applications all the time
研究人員一直都在發現我們的作業系統與應用程式中的新漏洞，

so it's important that you always stay up-to-date.
因此你一定要保持系統更新。

Make sure that you keep your operating system updated with the latest patches immediately after they are made available to you.
當系統釋出更新修補時，要立刻安裝最新的安全更新。

And make sure that your applications are updated.
也要確保你的應用程式保持更新。

Things like Adobe Flash are constantly updated because vulnerabilities are found often in those particular kinds of applications.
像 Adobe Flash 這類軟體常常出現漏洞，所以會經常更新。

🔹 保護自己免受惡意軟體攻擊
By performing some of these best practices, you can do your part to be able to keep this malware off of your computer and away from your data.
透過實施這些最佳做法，你就能保護電腦遠離惡意軟體，保護你的資料安全。
================================================================================4
computer viruses are named after human viruses that are able to propagate themselves from person to person
電腦病毒的命名是來自於人類病毒，因為人類病毒能夠在人與人之間傳播。

a computer virus can propagate itself from device to device and it doesn't necessarily need you to click anything but it does need to run or execute a program in your computer to be able to use that replication function
電腦病毒能夠在裝置之間傳播，它不一定需要你點擊什麼，但必須在你的電腦上運行或執行某個程式，才能進行自我複製的功能。

it can also replicate through file systems it can replicate through the network it may be just simply having an executable on your system would then allow it to find its way onto other systems on your network
它也可以透過檔案系統複製，或者透過網路複製，甚至只要系統中有可執行檔，就可能讓它找到方法感染網路上的其他系統。

a virus that's running on your computer may not necessarily be the end of the world it might not be a really bad virus it may be performing a very simple function that doesn't bother anything else that's running on your computer
正在你電腦中執行的病毒，不一定會造成毀滅性的影響，可能只是執行一些簡單的功能，並不會影響其他正在運作的程式。

some viruses are simply invisible you can't really see that they're running on your computer at all while others may provide annoying pop-ups and make themselves very obvious on your computer
有些病毒是完全隱形的，你無法察覺它們正在執行，而有些病毒會彈出討厭的廣告，讓你很明顯知道它們存在。

this is why many of our systems have antivirus software that will run where they are going to check and make sure that none of these known viruses are executing inside of your computer and if one does try to execute it will stop it immediately and quarantine it to a separate part of your storage device
這就是為什麼很多系統會安裝防毒軟體，防毒軟體會檢查並確保沒有已知病毒在電腦中執行，一旦偵測到病毒嘗試執行，就會立即阻止並隔離到儲存裝置的隔離區。

it's because of these viruses that we run antivirus software on our computers and since there are thousands of new viruses discovered every week we have to make sure that we maintain the signature list that's on our antivirus software that way if this virus does try to execute on your computer the antivirus software will recognize it and stop it before it installs itself onto your computer
正是因為有這些病毒，我們才會在電腦上使用防毒軟體，而且每週都有數千個新病毒被發現，
所以我們必須保持防毒軟體的病毒碼（簽名）清單更新，這樣當病毒嘗試執行時，防毒軟體才能辨識並在病毒安裝到電腦前阻止它。

there are many different kinds of viruses probably the most well known viruses are those that are attached to or associated with an application we run the application and in running that application we also run the virus software itself
病毒種類很多，最著名的是附著或關聯於應用程式的病毒，我們執行應用程式時，也會同時執行病毒程式。

some viruses are installed as part of the boot sector it doesn't necessarily even need your operating system to function it is inside the boot sector itself and you have to inoculate the boot sector to remove the virus
有些病毒會安裝在開機區（boot sector），甚至不需要作業系統就能運作，你必須針對開機區進行處理（消毒）才能移除這些病毒。

some viruses will run as scripts either as part of the operating system or inside of your browser and even other viruses are part of macros that may be associated with a spread or word processing application
有些病毒會以腳本方式執行，可能是作業系統的一部分，或在瀏覽器內執行，還有病毒是附著在試算表或文字處理應用程式中的巨集（macro）。

one type of virus that can be very damaging is a worm a worm is a type of virus that can move itself between systems it doesn't need any type of human intervention and it can use the network that's already in place to move from one computer to another
一種很具破壞力的病毒是蠕蟲（worm），它可以自動在系統間移動，不需要人為介入，並利用現有的網路從一台電腦傳播到另一台。

because of this we find that worms will propagate themselves and spread very quickly not only in a local area but worldwide as you can imagine because these worms move so quickly it's difficult to contain them once they begin propagating
因此，蠕蟲會快速自我複製並擴散，不只在區域網路中，甚至是全球範圍。你可以想像，一旦蠕蟲開始傳播，就很難阻止。

they can take over your systems extremely quickly if there's a vulnerability that affects a large number of systems you can find that many of those systems would be infected very very quickly before you had any chance to remove this worm from the network
如果有漏洞影響大量系統，蠕蟲會非常迅速感染這些系統，你幾乎沒有時間將蠕蟲從網路中移除。

if this worm is one that's already well-known you may be able to filter it with the next-generation firewall or an intrusion prevention system those signature-based systems can filter out these worms so they won't pass through any of those important security components
如果這個蠕蟲是已知的，你可能可以用下一代防火牆或入侵防禦系統（IPS）來過濾它，這些依靠病毒碼的系統能阻擋蠕蟲，防止它通過重要的安全防護設備。

here's the steps that take place to have a worm propagate throughout the networks this is an example of the wanna cry worm which is also called the wanna crypt worm because it encrypted the data that was on our computers
以下是蠕蟲在網路中傳播的步驟，以 WannaCry 蠕蟲為例，它也被稱為 WannaCrypt，因為它會加密電腦上的資料。

it first starts with a computer that's already infected has the wanna crypt worm already running on that system
它首先是從一台已經感染且正在執行 WannaCrypt 蠕蟲的電腦開始。

this device now looks over the network to try to find another system that has exactly the same kind of vulnerability that it can use to get embedded in
這台設備會在網路中搜尋另一台有相同漏洞的系統，藉此將自己植入該系統。

this particular worm used one that took advantage of a vulnerability in Microsoft's SMB version one this server message block is used to transfer files with Microsoft Windows so it affected a large number of Windows systems
這隻蠕蟲利用了微軟 SMB v1（伺服器訊息區塊版本一）的漏洞，SMB 用於 Windows 系統間的檔案傳輸，因此影響大量 Windows 系統。

once it goes over the network and finds a device that is susceptible to this particular kind of vulnerability it then installs and runs some software to embed itself onto that computer and becomes exploited
當它在網路中找到有漏洞的裝置，就會安裝並執行軟體，將自己植入該電腦並加以利用。

in this case with a third party utility called eternal blue eternal blue then installs a back door and that backdoor software reaches out to the mothership and downloads the latest version of wanna crime and now we have another system that is infected
這個案例中，利用了名為 EternalBlue 的第三方工具，EternalBlue 會安裝後門軟體，並連線至控制伺服器下載最新版的 WannaCry，於是又有另一台系統被感染。

the process begins again by fie being a vulnerable system the back door is installed the software is downloaded and another system becomes encrypted
過程再次開始：找到易受攻擊的系統，安裝後門，下載軟體，另一台系統被加密。

and this worm was able to operate throughout the internet without any type of user intervention hopping from one computer to another and trying to find as many devices as possible to encrypt the data running on those systems you
這隻蠕蟲能在沒有使用者干預的情況下，透過網際網路自動在電腦間跳躍，嘗試找到盡可能多的裝置來加密這些系統上的資料。
================================================================================5
The most valuable asset associated with your computers, whether their computers at home or computers at work, is your data.
與你的電腦相關的最寶貴資產，不論是在家用的電腦還是工作用的電腦，都是你的「資料」。

That is the most important asset on there.
這是上面最重要的資產。

At home, you probably have family pictures.
在家裡，你可能有家庭照片。

There's videos of trips that you've taken.
有旅行的影片。

There's important documents that you've scanned, and they're all on these storage devices at home.
有掃描過的重要文件，這些都儲存在家裡的儲存裝置裡。

At work, you probably even have a broader set of data.
在工作場所，你擁有的資料範圍可能更廣泛。

There's planning information, employee details, you've got financial information, and of course, company proprietary data.
有規劃資訊、員工資料、財務資訊，當然還有公司的專有資料。

There's a lot of valuable information here, 
and there's probably a certain amount of money that you would be willing to pay if all of this data 
disappeared tomorrow and somebody offered to give it back to you.
這裡有很多寶貴的資訊，假如明天這些資料全部消失，現在有人願意付錢把資料還給你，你大概也會願意花一筆錢去買回這些資料。

This is the business model for ransomware.
這就是「勒索軟體（ransomware）」的商業模式。

It's one where the bad guys want your money and the best way to get the money from you is to take the data away from you.
壞人想要你的錢，而拿走你的資料是他們取得錢財的最佳方法。

Your entire computer becomes unusable because everything that is important on that computer suddenly becomes encrypted.
你的整台電腦會變得無法使用，因為電腦上所有重要的資料突然都被加密了。

In some cases, ransomware is not even legitimate.
有時候，勒索軟體甚至不是真的加密資料，legitimate(合法的)

It's simply a fake message that's put on your screen.
而是偽裝成勒索訊息出現在你螢幕上。

They might use the Department of Justice logo or mention the FBI, 
and they've told you that the police have locked your computer.
他們可能會用司法部或 FBI 的標誌，告訴你警察鎖定了你的電腦。

If this is ransomware that is not real, then you may be able to take it to a security professional 
and have them retrieve the files and remove the fake ransomware from your computer without damaging or losing any data.
如果這是假勒索軟體，你可以請資安專家幫忙取回檔案，並移除這個假的勒索訊息，而不會損失資料。

These days, however, there is an entire new generation of malware called crypto-malware.
但現代有一整代新的惡意軟體叫做「加密勒索軟體（crypto-malware）」，

This is ransomware that encrypts all of the data on your computer and holds that data for ransom.
它會真正加密你電腦上的所有資料，然後向你勒索贖金。

It's going to encrypt all of your data files.
它會加密你所有的資料檔案。

So on your home computer, you probably have those pictures, and your documents, and your movies, and your music.
例如家裡電腦裡的照片、文件、影片、音樂。

And it encrypts everything except the operating system.
但會保留作業系統正常運作，

It wants your system to continue working so that it can present a message 
to you saying that all of your files have been encrypted, 
and this is the process that you should go through to send the bad guys some bitcoin 
so that your computer can then have a decryption key apply to all of these files and you can regain access to your data.
讓你可以看到一個訊息告訴你所有檔案已被加密，並說明你該怎麼做（通常是要付比特幣）才能拿到解密金鑰，重新取得檔案。

This has become a very lucrative and very successful business model for the bad guys.
這已經成為壞人非常賺錢且成功的商業模式。

They know that they're using a payment system that is untraceable, 
so you have no idea who you're sending this money to, or where they happen to be.
他們利用一種無法追蹤的支付系統，所以你根本不知道錢送去哪裡、給誰。

And it is using public key cryptography.
而且使用的是公開金鑰加密技術，

So it's using a very strong encryption, and there's no way to decrypt the data.
這種加密非常強大，沒有金鑰就無法解密資料。

You have to get the key from the bad guys or all of this data will be lost forever.
你必須從壞人那邊拿到解密金鑰，否則這些資料就永遠失去。

Or will it, because if you're someone who is very smart with handling your data, 
then you probably have a backup of this data somewhere, and you'll be able to recover all of those pictures and all of those videos.
不過，如果你是很懂得備份資料的人，你可能在其他地方有備份，可以還原這些照片和影片。

Make sure you have a backup and make sure that this backup is kept offline.
所以務必要做好備份，且備份要保持離線狀態，

A lot of the modern crypto-malware will find your backup systems if they're online and encrypt the backups as well.
因為很多現代的加密勒索軟體會自動尋找線上的備份系統並加密它們。

One of the ways this crypto-malware embeds itself onto your computer is taking advantage of a known vulnerability.
加密勒索軟體之所以能感染你的電腦，一個方法是利用已知的漏洞，

So make sure that you are always updating your operating system and all of your applications are updated to the latest versions.
所以你一定要保持作業系統和所有應用程式都是最新版本。

One way to stop this malware from executing on your computer is to have your anti-virus already recognize the malware, 
and for that to occur we have to have the latest signatures for your anti-virus software.
另外，一個防止這類惡意軟體執行的方法，就是讓你的防毒軟體能認得這些惡意軟體，而這就需要你經常更新防毒軟體的病毒特徵碼。

Make sure that you're constantly updating these anti-virus signatures and you may be able to stop the malware right in its tracks.
持續更新防毒軟體特徵碼，能讓你有機會當場攔截惡意軟體。

If you're updating your anti-virus signatures, you're updating your operating system, 
and you're updating your applications, you've got the best chance at avoiding any type of infection from this crypto-malware.
如果你持續更新防毒軟體、作業系統和應用程式，會是避免感染加密勒索軟體的最佳方法。
================================================================================6
The malware that we call a Trojan horse comes from the Trojan War where the Greeks used this fake horse 
to capture(捕獲) the City of Troy from the Trojans.
我們所稱的特洛伊木馬（Trojan horse）惡意軟體，源自於特洛伊戰爭中希臘人用假木馬攻陷特洛伊城的故事。

This digital version of the Trojan horse is an application that pretends to be something other 
than malware in an effort(努力) to entice(吸引) you into running this application.
這個數位版的特洛伊木馬是一種偽裝成正常應用程式的惡意軟體，試圖引誘你去執行它。

It wants to run in your computer so that it can then embed itself.
它想在你的電腦上執行，以便能夠植入系統中。

And at that point, it's on your computer and can perform whatever functions it would like.
一旦植入，它就能在你的電腦上執行任何它想做的事。

If your anti-virus or your anti-malware software is already aware of this Trojan horse software, 
it will be able to then stop it from executing even though you're the one that initiated(啟動) the process.
如果你的防毒或反惡意軟體能識別這個特洛伊木馬，它就能阻止這程式執行，即使是你自己啟動它的。

Once this Trojan horse software gets inside of your computer, it has as much access to your system as you do.
一旦這個木馬程式進入你的電腦，它就擁有跟你一樣的系統權限。

So this is a very easy way for malware to find its way inside of your computer with as little effort as possible.
因此，這是一種惡意軟體能輕易入侵電腦的方法，幾乎不需要太多努力。

Getting into your computer is simply the first step.
入侵電腦只是第一步而已。

At that point, the malware needs to open a door so
此時，惡意軟體需要開一扇門，

that other software can come onto your computer and that open door is the back door to your operating system.
讓其他軟體可以進入你的電腦，而這扇開啟的門就是你作業系統的「後門」。

They're not coming through the front where you happen to be, 
they're now opening up a small hole in your operating system that other applications, 
malware, and botnets can then communicate(交流) directly to your computer.
它們不是從你看得見的正門進來，而是開了一個小漏洞，讓其他應用程式、惡意軟體或殭屍網路可以直接連線到你的電腦。

These backdoors set themselves up with software that then communicate to the outside of your network, 
effectively(有效的) creating a way back in for other types of malware.
這些後門會設置程式，與外部網路通訊，等於幫其他惡意軟體創造一條回到你電腦的通道。

One of the problems we have is we're never quite sure if the software 
that we're using doesn't already have some type of a backdoor built into it.
一個問題是，我們永遠無法完全確定我們正在使用的軟體裡是否早就已經內建了某種後門。

Some very old Linux kernels, for example, had a backdoor written into their software.
例如，一些非常老的 Linux 核心裡就曾有過後門程式。

Even bad software that you might download that is legitimate software that you're using from a legitimate publisher 
may have a backdoor that was programmed in by some of their developers, 
whether it was supposed to be used for debugging and troubleshooting purposes or not, 
it's a door that's now open and makes everything else available to your computer.
甚至有些你從合法來源下載的正常軟體，也可能被某些開發人員植入後門，無論這後門是用於除錯還是非預期用途，它終究是一扇開啟的門，讓其他東西可以存取你的電腦。

One category of a Trojan horse that sets up a backdoor and 
begins to provide administrative access to your computer is a remote access Trojan.
一種類型的特洛伊木馬會建立後門並提供管理者權限，稱為「遠端存取木馬」（Remote Access Trojan, RAT）。

These RATs are often downloaded with other types of software, 
and once you execute that software, they embed themselves into your operating system.
這些 RAT 通常會隨其他軟體一起被下載，一旦你執行那個軟體，它們就會植入你的作業系統中。

You might also see these referred to(提到) as Remote Administration Tools.
你也可能看到它們被稱作「遠端管理工具」。

This allows a third party to gain unprecedented(前所未有) access to your computer.
這讓第三方可以獲得前所未有的電腦控制權。

Once it installs this malware, it's installing into the operating system as a service, 
and now the bad guys can simply connect with their client software and control many aspects(方面) of your computer.
一旦它被安裝，它會以服務的形式註冊在系統中，壞人就能用他們的客戶端軟體來操控你的電腦。

For example, they may set up a keylogger, 
so they'll know everything that you type into the keyboard.
例如，他們可能會安裝鍵盤側錄器（keylogger），記錄你所有的輸入內容。

They might be recording your screen or capturing screen shots.
他們可能會錄影你的畫面或截圖。

They can copy files from their computer to yours or from your computer to theirs.
他們可以在你的電腦與他們之間傳送檔案。

And of course, they can use this open door to install more malware onto your computer.
當然，他們也能透過這扇已打開的門，再安裝更多惡意軟體到你的電腦裡。

I installed the DarkComet RAT onto a couple of tests systems that I have.
我曾在幾台測試機上安裝了 DarkComet RAT。

I don't recommend(推薦) you doing this on a production system.
我不建議你在正式環境下這樣做。

I set up separate virtual machines in a completely isolated(孤立) system to be able to install this malware.
我是使用完全隔離的虛擬機器來安裝這個惡意軟體。

And as you can see, the DarkComet RAT allows the end user to look at the System Information on this computer.
你可以看到，DarkComet RAT 讓使用者能查看電腦的系統資訊。

It can look and perform scripts, transfer files, look at stored passwords, 
or even listen to the microphone or view what's happening on your web cam, all from this single administration front end.
它可以執行指令碼、傳送檔案、查看儲存的密碼，甚至監聽麥克風或查看你的攝影機畫面，全部透過一個管理介面完成。

One way to prevent these remote access Trojans from being installed 
is to really examine the software that you're installing on your computer.
防止這類遠端木馬被安裝的方法之一，就是仔細檢查你安裝的每一套軟體。

This is not a situation(情況) where you can trust anything that you download from the internet.
這不是一個可以隨便信任網路下載內容的情況。

You really need to make sure you know what's being installed.
你必須確保你知道自己安裝的是什麼。

Make sure that your anti-virus and your anti-malware is always up to date.
確保你的防毒與反惡意軟體都保持最新狀態。

Those signature updates are something that I update every hour, you might want to at a minimum set these to be updated every day.
我自己是每小時更新一次病毒定義檔，你至少也應該設定每天更新。

You also want to make sure that you have a backup, if this malware does get on to your computer, 
it may be very difficult to remove it from your operating system.
你還應該確保自己有備份，因為如果這個惡意軟體真的入侵，可能很難從作業系統中移除。

It might be easier to simply restore from a known good backup.
有時候還原自一個已知良好的備份，會比移除惡意軟體還快。
================================================================================7
In the Windows operating system, the highest level user of the operating system is the administrator user.
在 Windows 作業系統中，最高等級的使用者是「系統管理員（administrator）」。

In the Linux operating system, the highest level user is the root user 
and that's where we get the name for rootkit, is this highest level user on a Unix or Linux device.
在 Linux 作業系統中，最高權限的使用者是「root 使用者」，而「rootkit」這個名稱就是源自於 Unix 或 Linux 系統中的這個最高權限帳號。

A rootkit modifies the kernel of the operating system.
Rootkit 會修改作業系統的核心（kernel）。

It's one that is going to the very lowest level of the operating system 
so that it can avoid a lot of the anti-virus or anti-malware software 
from identifying(識別) it in the normal part of the operating system.
它會深入作業系統的最底層，以避開大多數防毒或反惡意軟體的偵測，因為那些防護通常只掃描系統的正常區域。

It's generally invisible, because it's built into the kernel of the operating system itself.
它通常是隱形的，因為它直接嵌入作業系統的核心中。

If you were to bring up a Task Manager and look for this rootkit software, 
you would not see it running as part of the operating system.
如果你打開工作管理員（Task Manager）尋找 rootkit，你會發現它根本不會顯示在系統中正在執行的程式列表裡。

Traditional anti-virus and traditional anti-malware will not be able to see the rootkit, 
because it's invisible to the operating system.
傳統的防毒與反惡意軟體無法看到 rootkit，因為它對作業系統本身就是隱形的。

Once that rootkit becomes installed onto that computer, it becomes very difficult to remove.
一旦 rootkit 被安裝到電腦中，要將它移除會變得非常困難。

Rootkits are often combined with additional software
Rootkit 通常會與其他軟體結合，

to create malware that becomes very difficult to remove.
形成一種難以移除的惡意軟體。

A good example of this is with this older Zeus or Zbot malware, which has been around for years.
這方面一個很好的例子是「Zeus」或稱「Zbot」的惡意程式，它已經存在多年。

It's used to listen in to you accessing your bank account information, and then uses that to remove or transfer money out of your account.
它會監聽你存取銀行帳戶的資料，然後將錢從你的帳戶中移走或轉走。

Well Zeus and the Zbot itself became easy to remove,
後來 Zeus 或 Zbot 本身變得比較容易移除，

so what the malware authors did was combine it with a rootkit.
所以惡意軟體的開發者就把它和 rootkit 結合在一起。

(01:32)
The root would install itself into the kernel of the operating system, and then prevent you from removing any part of the malware that was running inside of the operating system itself.
rootkit 會安裝到作業系統的核心中，然後阻止你移除系統內正在執行的任何惡意程式。

So even if you saw the Zeus or the Zbot files running, you wouldn't be able to stop them.
所以即使你看到 Zeus 或 Zbot 正在執行的檔案，也無法終止它們。

It would give you an access denied.
系統會顯示「存取被拒」。

(01:51)
If you find the service and you try to disable the service, even if you're the administrator of the operating system, that rootkit in the kernel provides you with an access denied and you're not able to stop that Botnet from running.
即使你是系統管理員，發現並試圖停用該服務時，rootkit 也會讓你無法關閉它，顯示「拒絕存取」，使這個殭屍網路繼續運作。

Although a rootkit is mostly in the kernel,
雖然 rootkit 主要存在於核心中，

there may be parts of the operating system that are able to identify that one's running,
但作業系統中有些部分可能能夠偵測出 rootkit 正在執行，

so make sure that your anti-virus and your anti-malware scans are updated with the latest signatures.
所以請確保你的防毒與反惡意軟體的病毒碼（signature）都是最新的。

(02:17)
If you do find or suspect that a rootkit is on your computer, you will need a very specific rootkit remover to remove that software.
如果你發現或懷疑你的電腦上有 rootkit，你需要特別設計的 rootkit 移除工具來清除它。

It's not quite as simple as deleting a file that might be in your file system.
這不像刪除檔案那麼簡單。

You might also want to take advantage of using a computer that has a UEFI BIOS with secure boot,
你也可以考慮使用支援 UEFI BIOS 且開啟「安全啟動（Secure Boot）」的電腦，

so that it's able to look for and prevent any application from installing into the kernel of your operating system.
這樣系統就能偵測並防止任何應用程式試圖安裝到核心中。
================================================================================8
For most of us, the keyboard is the primary input method to our computers.
對大多數人來說，鍵盤是我們操作電腦的主要輸入方式。

We're typing in URLs, our passwords, information in emails, 
and practically(幾乎) everything that goes into the computer is going through that keyboard.
我們會輸入網址、密碼、電子郵件內容，幾乎所有資料都是透過鍵盤輸入進電腦。

A keylogger is a piece of software that's saving all of those keystrokes, 
putting them into a file, and then sending that file off to the bad guys.
鍵盤側錄器（Keylogger）是一種軟體，它會記錄所有的按鍵動作，儲存成檔案後，傳送給攻擊者。

A keylogger gets around a lot of the encryption methods that you put in place,
Keylogger 可以避開許多你原本設置的加密機制，

because you're obviously not inputting things in an encrypted form when you're using the keyboard.
因為你在使用鍵盤時，輸入的內容並沒有經過加密。

All of your keystrokes are in the clear.
你所有的按鍵輸入都是明文的。

You're typing in normal sentences and normal passwords, 
and no encryption is involved(涉及) when you're using the keyboard.
你輸入的是普通句子與密碼，當下並不會有加密的過程。

These keyloggers can also store other types of information besides keystrokes.
Keylogger 不只會紀錄按鍵內容，還可以儲存其他類型的資訊。

They might grab information that's in your clipboard,
它們可能會擷取你剪貼簿（clipboard）裡的資料，

they can store screenshot information,
也能儲存螢幕截圖，

and send all of that information off to the bad guys.
然後把這些資訊全部傳送給駭客。

I installed the DarkComet remote access trojan in a lab that's completely isolated 
from the rest of my network to give you an idea of what some of the bad guys would see once they received these logs.
我在一個完全與其他網路隔離的實驗環境中安裝了 DarkComet 遠端存取木馬（RAT），展示駭客收到記錄檔後會看到什麼。

In my notepad up here, I've typed in username and put username as Professor Messer.
在記事本中，我輸入了「username」，並將使用者名稱設為 Professor Messer。

And then his password. I put in a password, not a real password, just typing things in to a simple notepad.
接著輸入密碼（不是真正的密碼，只是隨便打幾個字），一樣是在簡單的記事本裡。

You can see that the keylogger captured the date and the time when this was opened.
你可以看到，Keylogger 記錄了這個記事本開啟的日期與時間。

It noticed that I was using Notepad. It had not been saved as a file. It was untitled(無標題).
它偵測到我使用的是記事本，檔案還沒儲存，檔名是「未命名」。

It knew exactly when I was doing it.
它清楚地記下了操作的時間點。

It also recorded all of my keystrokes, even when I put in a spacebar and then hit the backspace.
它也記錄下我所有的按鍵，包括空白鍵與倒退鍵（backspace）。

It logged all of that information into a file 
that can now be sent off to the bad guys for them to read through at their convenience(方便).
這些資訊全都被紀錄進檔案中，隨時可以傳給駭客慢慢查看。

These keyloggers are usually installed as a piece of well-known malware.
Keylogger 通常是與知名惡意軟體一起安裝的。

So if your anti-virus and your anti-malware has been updated with the latest signatures,
所以如果你的防毒與反惡意軟體有更新到最新病毒碼，

they'll be able to stop it before it even executes inside of your computer.
它們可能能夠在 Keylogger 執行前就將其阻止。

If the malware does get installed onto your computer,
但如果惡意軟體還是成功安裝了，

another place to stop the process will be 
during the exfiltration(滲透) process as those files are sent off to the bad guys.
你還可以在「資料外洩階段」阻擋它，防止這些檔案被傳給駭客。

So you could set up firewall rules or some monitoring software 
to help watch for any file transfers occurring(發生) from your computer.
你可以設定防火牆規則，或使用監控軟體，來監控電腦是否有可疑的檔案傳輸行為。

There are also standalone keylogging scanners 
that can watch for these keylogging process to occur in the operating system,
市面上也有獨立的 Keylogger 偵測工具，可以監控這類側錄行為是否在系統中發生，

and prevent them from capturing data or sending that data to the bad guys.
進而防止它們擷取資料，或將資料傳送給駭客。
================================================================================9
One very lucrative(有利潤) way to make money on the internet is by displaying advertising.
在網路上賺錢的一個非常有利可圖的方法就是展示廣告。

The bad guys know this, and they've come up with many interesting ways 
to have pop-ups and other advertisements appear on your screen.
壞人知道這點，所以他們想出許多有趣的方法讓彈出視窗與其他廣告出現在你的螢幕上。

One way this occurs is by installing adware on your computer.
其中一種方式是將廣告軟體安裝到你的電腦上。

And once the adware begins executing, it can then begin popping up messages, showing you advertisements,
一旦這些廣告軟體開始執行，它們就會開始彈出訊息、展示廣告，

and in some cases, slowing down the performance of your computer, especially if it's on a network 
and is able to present a lot of different advertising simultaneously(同時的).
在某些情況下，甚至會拖慢你的電腦效能，尤其當它連接到網路上、能同時顯示大量廣告時。

Sometimes, adware is installed along with another application.
有時候，廣告軟體會隨著其他應用程式一起被安裝。

The adware creators will put their software inside something that is apparently(顯然的) normal to install
廣告軟體的創作者會把他們的軟體藏在看似正常的安裝程式中，

and just like a Trojan horse software might be when you install the very innocuous(無害的) software, 
the adware software is installed along with it.
就像特洛伊木馬一樣，當你安裝一個看起來無害的軟體時，廣告軟體也會一併被安裝。

One challenge with removing adware is knowing who to trust when it comes to the removal of adware.
移除廣告軟體的一個困難在於你不知道該信任誰來移除它。

The adware authors know that if you receive adware, that you're going to try to find a way to remove it
廣告軟體的開發者知道，一旦你中了廣告軟體，你會想辦法將它移除，

and they'll often present removal tools to you that are simply more adware methods to install onto your computer.
他們甚至會提供看似是移除工具的程式，但其實只是另外一種形式的廣告軟體，用來再次感染你的電腦。

Another type of malicious software is spyware.
另一種惡意軟體叫做間諜軟體（spyware）。

As the name implies, spyware is watching what you're doing.
顧名思義，間諜軟體會監視你正在做什麼。

It may watch what websites you visit.
它可能會監視你瀏覽了哪些網站。

It may embed its own affiliate codes into the sites that you visit.
它甚至會把自己的推廣代碼嵌入你造訪的網站中。

Or it may simply wait for you to input some personal information 
and steal that information to be able to use it in identity(身份) theft(竊盜) elsewhere(別處).
或者它會等你輸入個人資訊，然後偷取那些資訊來進行身分盜用。

Spyware is often software that tricks you into installing it,
間諜軟體通常會用詐騙的方式讓你自己安裝它，

either as posing as fake security software or installing 
it along with other types of software, such as peer-to-peer software.
可能是偽裝成假安全軟體，或是與其他類型的軟體（例如 P2P 軟體）一起被安裝。

This is now going to be in your system.
這樣一來，它就會進入你的系統中。

It's going to watch the sites that you browse to.
它會監視你造訪的網站。

It's going to capture the surfing habits of where you go on the internet.
它會記錄你上網的習慣與行為。

And it may even install its own set of key loggers to be able to capture information.
甚至還會安裝鍵盤側錄器（keylogger）來偷取輸入的資訊。

To be able to spy on everything that you're doing.
目的就是要監控你所做的一切。

If you look at the different types of malware, 
you'll find that adware and spyware is a very large percentage of the malware that's out there
如果你觀察各種惡意軟體，你會發現廣告軟體和間諜軟體佔了非常大的比例，

and that's because your eyeballs are worth money to the bad guys.
那是因為對壞人來說，你的注意力就是金錢。

And if they can embed this on to millions of systems, 
that's just that much more that they'll be able to make off of advertising.
如果他們能把這些東西安裝到數百萬台電腦上，就能靠廣告賺更多錢。

Your time and the bandwidth on your computer is also valuable.
你的時間與電腦的頻寬也有其價值。

They may be able to take advantage of your CPU and use it to mine for crypto-currency(加密-貨幣)
他們甚至可能利用你的 CPU 來挖加密貨幣，

or use it to watch for other things that you do on the internet.
或者監控你在網路上做的其他事情。

And if they're able to watch you as you log into your bank account,
如果他們能監看你登入銀行帳戶的過程，

then they will also be able to log in to your bank account where your money actually is
那他們也能登入你的銀行帳戶，拿走你的錢，

and then, remove the money directly from your account by transferring it somewhere else.
然後把錢直接從你的帳戶轉到別的地方。

Protecting against adware and spyware is similar to protecting yourself against other types of malware.
防範廣告軟體和間諜軟體的方式，跟防範其他惡意軟體類似。

Make sure that you have the latest signatures for your anti-virus and your anti-malware.
確保你的防毒軟體與反惡意軟體擁有最新的病毒定義檔。

Always be very particular(特別的，謹慎的) of the applications that you're installing.
對於你要安裝的應用程式一定要非常謹慎挑選。

And you should have a very good trust when you begin to install any new application on your computer.
在安裝任何新應用程式時，一定要確保來源可靠可信。

Also, make sure that you have a very good backup.
此外，請務必準備好可靠的備份。

Adware and spyware tends to embed itself very deeply in your operating system, which makes it very hard to remove.
廣告與間諜軟體常會深入嵌入你的作業系統，使它們難以移除。

It might be easier to simply restore from a known good backup.
有時候還不如直接從一個可靠的備份還原會更簡單。

And, of course, run some scans, not only with your anti-virus or anti-malware software,
當然，你也應該使用防毒軟體或反惡意軟體執行掃描，

but you may want to use a specialized malware software-- like Malwarebytes-- 
to really look for very specific(具體) malware infestations.
你甚至可以使用專門的惡意軟體掃描工具，例如 Malwarebytes，來找出特定的惡意感染程式。
===============================================================================10
A botnet is a very specialized(專門) kind of malware, it stands for robot networks.
殭屍網路（botnet）是一種非常特殊的惡意軟體，它的意思是「機器人網路」。

That means that there is a virtual robot inside of your computer performing functions that are being commanded to it.
這代表你的電腦裡有一個虛擬的機器人，它會根據遠端的命令執行特定的操作。

Your machine is infected, it now becomes one of the many devices that is part of this botnet.
一旦你的電腦被感染，它就會變成這個殭屍網路中眾多設備之一。

In most cases, the end user of the computer has no idea that this bot is even running inside of its computer.
在大多數情況下，使用者完全不知道電腦裡正執行著這個殭屍程式。

Well, how does it then get into the computer in the first place?
那麼，這種殭屍程式一開始是怎麼進入電腦的呢？

One way is through a Trojan horse.
其中一種方式是透過「木馬程式」。

You'll see these links all the time come into an email saying that I saw a funny video of you, click here to view it.
你常會在電子郵件中看到這樣的連結：「我看到你一個很好笑的影片，點這裡看」。

Maybe there is an email that comes through with something that appears to be related to things 
that were in the news and those clicks then take you to a site that installs the botnet software onto your computer.
或者是寄來一封看起來跟新聞事件有關的郵件，點進去後實際上會帶你到一個網站，並在你電腦中安裝殭屍網路程式。

Or the botnet developers will find a vulnerability in your operating system 
and take advantage(優勢) of that as the way into your computer.
又或者殭屍網路開發者會發現你作業系統的漏洞，並藉此入侵你的電腦。

Once the botnet software installs itself onto your computer, it doesn't do anything.
當殭屍網路程式安裝好之後，它不會立刻做任何事情。

It just sits there, and it waits for commands from the main system.
它會靜靜地待著，等待從主控系統發來的命令。

There is a centralized command and control system that will send out messages, 
the botnets are looking for those messages and then will perform 
whatever function is being asked of them in those commands from the mothership.
會有一個集中的指揮與控制系統（C&C），發送指令給這些殭屍電腦，它們一旦接收到命令，便會執行相應的行動。

One well-known botnet through the years is the ZeuS botnet.
歷年來有個著名的殭屍網路叫作「ZeuS（宙斯）殭屍網路」。

It's well known because it took money directly from your bank account 
and transferred it over to the bad guys.
它之所以惡名昭彰，是因為它會直接從你的銀行帳戶中把錢轉給駭客。

They developed the software and installed it onto your computer as a botnet, and then it waited for you to log into your bank.
駭客開發這個程式，安裝到你的電腦上後，它就會靜靜等待你登入網路銀行。

At that point, it transferred the information back to the bad guys 
who then logged in using your credentials and transferred the money to a third party 
who then eventually got the money back to the bad guys.
當你登入時，它會把帳號資訊傳回給駭客，駭客再利用你的帳號登入銀行，將錢轉給第三方，最終回到駭客手中。

There are many different kinds of botnets, and there's botnet activity happening constantly(不斷的).
殭屍網路有很多種類，它們的活動幾乎無時無刻不在進行中。

This is a real time view using the Looking Glass threat map.
這裡展示的是使用 Looking Glass 威脅地圖所呈現的即時畫面。

You can find this at map.lookingglasscyber.com.
你可以在 map.lookingglasscyber.com(已關閉) 查看，可以用 https://threatmap.checkpoint.com/ 查看。

This gives us an idea of how much traffic might be going across the network, 
what sites or areas may be attacked with live attacks.
這張地圖讓我們知道目前網路上的殭屍網路活動有多頻繁、哪些網站或地區正在遭受攻擊。

And you can see the real time view of the botnets.
你可以即時看到殭屍網路的活動畫面。

The sality botnet and the mobile botnets are the ones that are taking the most amount today.
目前最活躍的是 Sality 殭屍網路以及行動裝置上的殭屍網路。

But of course, these botnets come and go.
不過，這些殭屍網路有時候會出現、有時又會消失。

This is a good way to see what is happening right now with botnet communication anywhere in the world.
這是觀察全球殭屍網路即時通訊活動的好方法。

The developers of these botnets can have them operate(操作) as one large entity(實體).
殭屍網路的開發者可以讓這些受感染設備像一個巨大的統一體一樣行動。

They can send commands and have all of the devices perform those commands simultaneously.
他們可以發送命令，讓所有設備同時執行指令。

You see this being used a lot with a distributed(分散式) denial(拒絕) of service attack 
because you can have all the botnets descend(下降) upon(之上) one single website, 
effectively(有效的) overwhelming(壓倒性的) it, all from these very distributed botnets anywhere in the world.
這種方式常用於「分散式阻斷服務攻擊（DDoS）」，只要指令一下，全球各地的殭屍電腦就會同時攻擊一個網站，讓它癱瘓無法服務。

The botnet developers have realized that this is also an opportunity to make money.
殭屍網路開發者也發現，這是一個可以賺錢的機會。

So they will rent out time on the botnets, and if there's a site that you'd like to bring down, 
you can spend a certain amount of money to have a certain number of botnets descend on(降臨) that website, 
effectively, making it inaccessible(閉塞，無法訪問) by anybody for that amount of time.
他們會出租殭屍網路的使用時間，想要癱瘓網站的人只需花錢，就可以讓一堆殭屍電腦同時攻擊那個網站，讓它在特定時間內無法運作。

Stopping a botnet is similar to stopping any other type of malicious software.
防止殭屍網路感染的方法和防止其他惡意軟體相似。

We need to stop the initial infection by making sure that our operating system and our applications are updated to the latest versions.
我們要防堵初期感染，方法就是確保作業系統和應用程式都更新到最新版本。

We also want to be sure we have the latest signatures for our anti-virus and our anti-malware software.
我們也要確保防毒軟體和惡意軟體掃描工具的病毒碼是最新的。

You also might want to proactively scan your system every day or every week and 
have your anti-malware software look deeper to see if there might be an infection.
你也可以每天或每週主動掃描系統，讓防毒工具更深入地偵測是否有感染跡象。

It's also good to monitor your network and check for any incoming or outgoing traffic that you may not recognize.
監控網路流量也是好方法，可以檢查是否有不明的進出流量。

These botnets will usually log into a central chat room and wait for commands from the command and control center.
這些殭屍網路通常會登入一個中央聊天室，等待來自指揮中心的指令。

If you can block that traffic at the firewall or you install a host-based firewall or host-based IPS, 
you can block the traffic on the device and prevent that botnet from ever receiving commands from the command and control center.
如果你能在防火牆層級封鎖這些通訊，或使用主機型防火牆/入侵防禦系統（IPS），就能阻止殭屍電腦與指揮中心的聯繫，防止它們接收指令。
